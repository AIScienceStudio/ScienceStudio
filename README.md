## 🚀 What if research writing worked like research thinking?

Scientists don't think in linear documents. They think in **connections** — between ideas, papers, evidence, and arguments. 

**ScienceStudio** is the first IDE designed for the scientific method. Just as developers moved from text editors to intelligent IDEs, we're bringing that same evolution to research.

## 🧠 The B.R.P.W. Loop™

Research isn't typing — it's a cognitive loop. We've built our entire system around how scientists actually work:

<div align="center">

### **Brainstorm → Read → Plan → Write**

</div>

<table>
<tr>
<td width="25%" align="center">
<h3>🌟 Brainstorm</h3>
<p>Explore ideas with an AI that knows your entire research context</p>
</td>
<td width="25%" align="center">
<h3>📖 Read</h3>
<p>100 PDFs become a queryable knowledge graph, not a folder of files</p>
</td>
<td width="25%" align="center">
<h3>🗺️ Plan</h3>
<p>Structure arguments before writing — like architects before building</p>
</td>
<td width="25%" align="center">
<h3>✨ Write</h3>
<p>Focus on ideas while AI handles citations, consistency, and logic</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

## 🎯 Built for How Science Really Works

### Traditional Tools Force You To:
- 🔄 Alt-tab between 20 PDF windows
- 📝 Copy-paste citations manually
- 🔍 Ctrl+F through hundreds of pages
- 💭 Hold your entire argument in your head
- ⚡ Lose flow switching between apps

</td>
<td width="50%">

### ScienceStudio Lets You:
- 🧠 Query your entire library instantly
- 🔗 Click any citation to see its source
- 💡 Ask "What contradicts this claim?"
- 📊 Visualize argument structure
- 🚀 Stay in flow with unified workspace

**Your data never leaves your machine.** No cloud uploads. No training on your unpublished work. Complete privacy.

## ⚡ See It In Action

```python
# Traditional way: 
# 1. Remember Smith et al. mentioned something about cognitive load
# 2. Open 15 PDFs trying to find it
# 3. Manually copy the citation
# 4. Hope you formatted it correctly

# ScienceStudio way:
> "What did Smith's team conclude about cognitive load in children?"

AI: Found in Smith et al. (2023), p. 45: "Cognitive load significantly 
    impairs moral reasoning in children aged 8-10 (F(2,98) = 7.34, p < .001)"
