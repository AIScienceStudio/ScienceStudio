## What if research writing worked like research thinking?

Scientists don't think in linear documents. They think in **connections** — between ideas, papers, evidence, and arguments. 

We ask brilliant researchers to solve humanity’s hardest problems using the same tools designed for office memos (Microsoft Word). Word treats a 100-page thesis like a flat string of characters. It has no concept of a hypothesis, it breaks when you handle complex citations, and it has no memory of the 50 PDFs you just read.

ScienceStudio replaces the "Word + Zotero + 20 Chrome Tabs" workflow with a single, programmable environment. It treats your research paper not as a document, but as a codebase—structured, version-controlled, and logically verified.

## The Philosophy
Programmers moved from Notepad to VS Code because they needed tools that understood the structure of their code (definitions, references, refactoring). ScienceStudio brings this same leap to researchers.

We prioritize Local-First Intelligence. Your unpublished data is your most valuable asset. ScienceStudio runs entirely on your machine—no cloud uploads, no external model training.

## How it works - The B.R.P.W. Loop™

Research isn't typing — it's a cognitive loop. We've built our entire system around how scientists actually work:

<div align="center">

### **Brainstorm → Read → Plan → Write**

</div>

<table>
<tr>
<td width="25%" align="center">
<h3> Brainstorm</h3>
<p>Explore ideas with an AI that knows your entire research context</p>
</td>
<td width="25%" align="center">
<h3> Read</h3>
<p>100 PDFs become a queryable knowledge graph, not a folder of files</p>
</td>
<td width="25%" align="center">
<h3> Plan</h3>
<p>Structure arguments before writing — like architects before building</p>
</td>
<td width="25%" align="center">
<h3> Write</h3>
<p>Focus on ideas while AI handles citations, consistency, and logic</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Built for How Science Really Works

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Traditional Tools Force You To:
- Alt-tab between 20 PDF windows
- Copy-paste citations manually
- Ctrl+F through hundreds of pages
- Hold your entire argument in your head
- Lose flow switching between apps

</td>
<td width="50%">

### ScienceStudio Lets You:
- Query your entire library instantly
- Click any citation to see its source
- Ask "What contradicts this claim?"
- Visualize argument structure
- Stay in flow with unified workspace

## Powerful Tech, Invisible Complexity

```
Your Workspace                           Under the Hood
─────────────                           ──────────────
                                       
Clean writing space      ←→         VS Code Extension Platform
Smart PDF library        ←→         LanceDB (10k papers, 100MB RAM)
Research assistant       ←→         Local AI with your full context
Semantic search         ←→         Knowledge graph, not keyword matching
Living documents        ←→         Git-versioned, structured data
```

**Your data never leaves your machine.** No cloud uploads. No training on your unpublished work. Complete privacy.

## See It In Action

```python
# Traditional way: 
# 1. Remember Smith et al. mentioned something about cognitive load
# 2. Open 15 PDFs trying to find it
# 3. Manually copy the citation
# 4. Hope you formatted it correctly

# ScienceStudio way:
> "What did Smith's team conclude about cognitive load in children?"

AI: Found in Smith et al. (2023), p. 45: "Cognitive load significantly 
    impairs moral reasoning in children aged 8-10 (F(2,98) = 7.34, p < .001)"
