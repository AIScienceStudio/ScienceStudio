## Academic Writing Tool Usage

### Overview

| Tool | Est. Usage | Primary Users |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **MS Word** | 60-70% | Biology, Medicine, Social Sciences, Humanities |
| **LaTeX** | 10-30% | Math, Physics, CS, Engineering |
| **Google Docs** | 10-20% | Collaboration, Early Drafts |

*Note: No formal peer-reviewed survey exists. Estimates from academic forums and community data.*

### By Discipline

| Field | Primary Tool | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| Mathematics | LaTeX (90%+) | Equations, proofs require LaTeX |
| Theoretical Physics | LaTeX (90%+) | Heavy math, arXiv submissions |
| Computer Science | LaTeX (70-80%) | Conferences require LaTeX |
| Engineering | Mixed (50/50) | Depends on subfield |
| Biology | Word (80%+) | Journals accept Word |
| Medicine | Word (90%+) | Clinical journals prefer Word |
| Social Sciences | Word (85%+) | APA formatting in Word |
| Humanities | Word (90%+) | Track changes for editing |
| Law | Word (95%+) | Track changes essential |

### Key Insights

1. **Word dominates overall** - Most researchers use Word/Docs
2. **LaTeX dominates STEM math-heavy fields** - Non-negotiable for equations
3. **Collaboration drives Google Docs** - But final submission usually Word/LaTeX
4. **Journal requirements matter** - Many journals require specific formats

### Why Support Both?

**Word (.docx) via OnlyOffice:**
- 60-70% of researchers
- Required by most journals
- Track changes for co-author collaboration
- Familiar to advisors/reviewers

**LaTeX (.tex) via Custom Editor:**
- 10-30% of researchers (but 70-90% in STEM math fields)
- Required by CS/Math/Physics conferences (ACM, IEEE, arXiv)
- Better equation support
- Version control friendly (plain text)

**Combined Coverage:** ~95%+ of academic researchers

### Competitor Analysis

| Tool | Word | LaTeX | AI | Local |
|------|------|-------|-----|-------|
| MS Word | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ Copilot | ❌ |
| Google Docs | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ Gemini | ❌ |
| Overleaf | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **ScienceStudio** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Our differentiator:** Only tool that supports BOTH Word AND LaTeX with AI assistance AND local-first architecture.

### Target User Segments

**Segment 1: Psychology/Biology PhD (Word users)**
- Primary persona (Andy's girlfriend)
- 50-100 PDFs, writes in Word
- Needs: Citation management, evidence finding
- Tool: OnlyOffice + MCP servers

**Segment 2: CS/Math PhD (LaTeX users)**
- Writes papers in LaTeX
- Submits to arXiv, ACM, IEEE
- Needs: BibTeX management, equation help
- Tool: LaTeX editor + MCP servers

**Segment 3: Cross-disciplinary Researcher**
- Sometimes Word, sometimes LaTeX
- Collaborates with people in both camps
- Needs: Both tools in one place
- Tool: ScienceStudio (both editors)

### Market Size (Rough Estimates)
